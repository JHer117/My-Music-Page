I'm able to sing multiple genres/styles but my favorite and best performance is reflected in the hard rock genres. My range is anywhere from Bass/Baritone to Alto1/Alto2.

        <h2>Songwriter</h2>
        <p class="info_head text-justify text-center">I can play it all, and know how it all fits together...</p>
        <p class="lead"><span class="info_span">Being able to play every basic instrument</span> has it's advantages when writing music. Also being a vocalist and lyricist, I can paint the whole musical picture and have written, perfomred, and recorded multiple songs completely solo. It can start with either a simple guitar lick or a melody in my head, but before long I have a complete song ready to record or jam out. In every band I've sung in I was the sole lyricist. My songwriting abilites span multiple genres as well. I've written full acoustic songs, full band songs, with all instruments, as well as some experimental pieces that include keyboard and piano parts. Songwriting in all it's capacities comes easy to me and I love the process of hammering out the finer details of what can make a song a truly unique and interesting piece of music.</p>
